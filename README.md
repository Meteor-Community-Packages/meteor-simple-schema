simple-schema
=========================

A simple, reactive schema validation smart package for Meteor. It's used by the [collection2](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-collection2) and [autoform](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform) packages, but you can use it by itself, too.

## Basic Usage

If you're using the `autoform` or `collection2` package, you define your schema as part of constructing those objects. Otherwise,
set up a SimpleSchema instance like so:

```js
MySchema = new SimpleSchema({
    key: {
        type: type, //allow only this data type
        label: "Name", //how to refer to this key in the error messages;
                       //default is the key name itself
        optional: true, //default is false, meaning the key must be present
        min: min, //minimum numeric value, or minimum string length,
                  //or minimum date, inclusive
        max: max, //maximum numeric value, or maximum string length,
                  //or maximum date, inclusive
        minCount: minCount, //minimum array length, used only if type is an array
        maxCount: maxCount, //maximum array length, used only if type is an array
        allowedValues: [], //an array of allowed values; the key's value
                           //must match one of these
        valueIsAllowed: function, //a function that accepts the value as
                                  //its first argument and the full document
                                  //or modifier object as its second argument
                                  //and returns true if the value is allowed
        decimal: true, //default is false; set to true if type=Number
                       //and you want to allow non-integers
        regEx: /[0-255]/, //any regular expression that must be matched
                          //for the key to be valid
    }
});
```

### Types

Type can be a standard Javascript object like:
* `String`
* `Number`
* `Boolean`
* `Object`

Or it can be a constructor function like `Date`.

Or it can be any of those wrapped in array brackets, to indicate that you're expecting an array of values
of that type.
* `[String]`
* `[Number]`
* `[Boolean]`
* `[Object]`
* `[Date]`

### Keys

A basic schema key is just the name of the key to expect in the objects that will be validated.
If necessary, though, you can use string keys with mongo-style dot notation to validate
nested arrays and objects.

For example:

```js
MySchema = new SimpleSchema({
    "mailingAddress.street": {
        type: String,
    },
    "mailingAddress.city": {
        type: String,
    }
});
```

To indicate the presence of an array, use a `$`:

```js
MySchema = new SimpleSchema({
    "addresses.$.street": {
        type: String,
    },
    "addresses.$.city": {
        type: String,
    }
});
```

In the example above, adding the `addresses` key itself isn't necessary, but
you could do so if you want to, particularly if you want to specify a minimum or maximum array count:

```js
MySchema = new SimpleSchema({
    addresses: {
        type: [Object],
        minCount: 1,
        maxCount: 4
    },
    "addresses.$.street": {
        type: String,
    },
    "addresses.$.city": {
        type: String,
    }
});
```

### Provided RegEx Patterns

A global object, `SchemaRegEx`, is exported. It defines standard regular expressions you can use
as the value for the `regEx` key in the schema. Currently `SchemaRegEx.Email` and
`SchemaRegEx.Url` are the only values. Feel free to add more with a pull request.

## Cleaning Data

Your SimpleSchema object has two methods you can use to clean data in an object.

### SimpleSchema.filter(obj)

Removes keys from obj if they are not listed in the schema. Returns the filtered object. It's a
good idea to call this method before validating if you're dealing with user-entered data.

### SimpleSchema.autoTypeConvert(obj)

Returns an object that has values automatically type-converted to match the schema,
if possible. For example, non-string values can be converted to a String if the
schema expects a String, and strings that are numbers can be converted to Numbers
if the schema expects a Number. It's a good idea to call this method before
validating if you're dealing with user-entered data, so as to avoid unnecessary
validation errors.

## Validating Data

To validate an object against the schema, use `MySchema.validate(obj)`. This
method returns undefined, but it also stores a list of invalid fields and corresponding
error messages in the SimpleSchema object.

Now you can call `MySchema.valid()` to see if the object passed into `validate()`
was found to be valid. This is a reactive method that returns true or false.

### Validating Only One Key

You may have the need to validate just one key. For this, use `MySchema.validateOne(obj, key)`.
Only the specified schema key will be validated. This may cause all of the
reactive methods to react.

### Other Methods

Call `MySchema.invalidKeys()` to get the full array of invalid key data. Each object
in the array has three keys:
* `name`: The schema key as specified in the schema.
* `type`: The type of error. One of the following strings:
    * required
    * minString
    * maxString
    * minNumber
    * maxNumber
    * minDate
    * maxDate
    * minCount
    * maxCount
    * noDecimal
    * notAllowed
    * expectedString
    * expectedNumber
    * expectedBoolean
    * expectedArray
    * expectedObject
    * expectedConstructor
    * regEx
* `message`: The error message.

This is a reactive method.

`MySchema.keyIsInvalid(key)` returns true if the specified key is currently
invalid, or false if it is valid. This is a reactive method.

`MySchema.keyErrorMessage(key)` returns the error message for the specified
key if it is invalid. If it is valid, this method returns an empty string. This
is a reactive method.

Call `MySchema.schema(key)` to get the original schema object that you passed in
as the only argument to the SimpleSchema constructor function. If you specify a
key, then only that schema key's value (the schema definition for that key) 
is returned.

Call `MySchema.resetValidation()` if you need to reset the SimpleSchema object,
clearing out any invalid field messages.

A schema can be passed as the second argument of the built-in `check()` function. 
This will throw a Match.Error if the object specified in the first argument is not
valid according to the schema. It works with `Match.test` as well:
```js
var mySchema = new SimpleSchema({name: {type: String}});

Match.test({name: 'Steve'}, mySchema); // Return true
Match.test({admin: true}, mySchema); // Return false
check({admin: true}, mySchema); // throw a Match.Error
```

### The Object

The object you pass in when validating can be a normal object, or it can use the $set or $unset
format of a mongo-style object. In other words, you can pass in the exact object
that you are going to pass to `Collection.insert()` or `Collection.update()`. This
is what the collection2 smart package does for you.

## Customizing Validation Messages

To customize validation messages, pass a messages object to `SimpleSchema.messages()`.
The format of the messages object is:

```js
{
  errorType: message
}
```

You can also specify override messages for specific fields:

```js
{
  "errorType schemaKey": message
}
```

The message is a string. It can contain a number of different placeholders indicated by square brackets:
* `[label]` will be replaced with the field label
* `[min]` will be replaced with the minimum allowed value (string length, number, or date)
* `[max]` will be replaced with the maximum allowed value (string length, number, or date)
* `[minCount]` will be replaced with the minimum array count
* `[maxCount]` will be replaced with the maximum array count
* `[value]` will be replaced with the value that was provided to save but was invalid (not available for all error types)
* `[type]` will be replaced with the expected type; useful for the `expectedConstructor` error type

By way of example, here is what it would look like if you defined the default error messages yourself:

```js
MySchema.messages({
    required: "[label] is required",
    minString: "[label] must be at least [min] characters",
    maxString: "[label] cannot exceed [max] characters",
    minNumber: "[label] must be at least [min]",
    maxNumber: "[label] cannot exceed [max]",
    minDate: "[label] must be on or before [min]",
    maxDate: "[label] cannot be after [max]",
    minCount: "You must specify at least [minCount] values",
    maxCount: "You cannot specify more than [maxCount] values",
    noDecimal: "[label] must be an integer",
    notAllowed: "[value] is not an allowed value",
    expectedString: "[label] must be a string",
    expectedNumber: "[label] must be a number",
    expectedBoolean: "[label] must be a boolean",
    expectedArray: "[label] must be an array",
    expectedObject: "[label] must be an object",
    expectedConstructor: "[label] must be a [type]",
    regEx: "[label] failed regular expression validation"
});
```

You should call this method on both the client and the server to make sure that your messages are consistent.
If you are interested in supporting multiple languages, you should be able to rerun this method
to change the messages at any time, for example, in an autorun function based on a language value stored in session
that loads the message object from static json files.

## Validating One Key Against Another

The second argument of the `valueIsAllowed` function is the full document or
mongo modifier object that's being validated. This allows you to declare one value
valid or invalid based on another value. Here's an example:

```js
MySchema = new SimpleSchema({
    password: {
        type: String,
        label: "Enter a password",
        min: 8
    },
    confirmPassword: {
        type: String,
        label: "Enter the password again",
        min: 8,
        valueIsAllowed: function (val, doc) {
            var pass = ("$set" in doc) ? doc.$set.password : doc.password;
            return pass === val;
        }
    }
});

MySchema.messages({
    "notAllowed confirmPassword": "Passwords do not match"
});
```

## Collection2 and AutoForm

This all becomes pretty great when put to use in the [collection2](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-collection2) and [autoform](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform) packages. Take a look at their documentation.
