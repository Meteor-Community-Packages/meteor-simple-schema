# Meteor Simple Schema

This package is back under the namespace `aldeed:simple-schema`!
The SimpleSchema NPM package dropped all Meteor compatibility beginning with
the Major Version update to 3.x and this package is now a wrapper
to support reactivity as it used to before.

## About

The package is a wrapper for the simple and lightweight validation library `simpl-schema` (npm package).
It's included in widely used packages, like `aldeed:collection2` or `aldeed:autoform`.

**All documentation in this repo is specific on usage with Meteor.**
